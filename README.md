### Future dreams:

At the moment I am still trying to keep my options open as much as possible. I found out during my internship that the things I like at school can become boring in a working environment, so I need to find out what I like working-wise to actually know what I want to achieve. One thing I do know is the way of working that I like, I want to be able to have flexibility and work on my own hours, and to achieve this I would like to start my own company. This way I hope to still have the flexibility to travel.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I change my favourite artist probably every week, right now it is Posty, I am having his album on repeat, it is so good.
